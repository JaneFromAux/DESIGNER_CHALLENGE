            <h3>Every idea <span><img src="assets/img/idea.png" alt="Gluehbirne"></span> starts with a need</h3>
            <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper
                and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with
                what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really
                liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
                problem.

                </h4>
                <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You
                    will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.

                        calling a taxi or even remembering something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay
                        close attention to your surroundings.
